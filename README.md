# Setting up the Project

First you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the package manager
that comes with it: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Once you've got that working, head to the command line where we'll set
up our project.

## Clone the Tutorial

```
https://github.com/athmangude/react-starter.git
cd react-router-tutorial
cd lessons/01-setting-up
npm install
npm start
```

Now open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
